# DataConveyer_SummarizeBmiData

DataConveyer_SummarizeBmiData is a console application to demonstrate how Data Conveyer can be
used to summarize data.

The process accepts input data in a form of a JSON file containing a list of people along with
their places of residence and some demographic information. Like so:

```json
{
  "Name":"Chucho Charleston",
  "Residence":"GA",
  "BirthDate":"1/19/1954",
  "Gender":"Male",
  "Height":{"ft":5,"in":8},
  "Weight":221
}
```

On the output, the application produces an XML file that summarizes population characteristics
per state. Like so:

```xml
<StateSummaryRecord>
  <State>AK</State>
  <TotalHeadount>12</TotalHeadount>
  <AverageHeight>4'11''</AverageHeight>
  <AverageWeight>204lbs</AverageWeight>
  <AverageBMI>44.2</AverageBMI>
  <OverweightHeadount>10</OverweightHeadount>
  <PercentageOverweight>83%</PercentageOverweight>
</StateSummaryRecord>
```

**Disclaimer 1**: The contents of a sample input file (PeopleDataByState.json located in the Data folder)
has been randomly generated and any possible resemblance to the actual population characteristics
is purely coincidental.

**Disclaimer 2**: Calculation formulas used in this application are approximations used for demonstration
purposes only and should not be used for any other purposes.
